# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive full-stack Python web scraping system that combines Selenium-based web scraping with AI-powered content processing. The system provides a complete solution for extracting, processing, and accessing web data through multiple interfaces including a Streamlit dashboard for monitoring and a RESTful API for programmatic access. The system is designed to handle dynamic web content, implement robust error handling, and provide automated data cleaning with flexible export capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to scrape data from any website including those with dynamic content, so that I can collect comprehensive web data regardless of the site's technology stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a website URL THEN the system SHALL use Selenium WebDriver to navigate and extract content
2. WHEN the website contains JavaScript-rendered content THEN the system SHALL wait for dynamic elements to load before extraction
3. WHEN the website requires interaction (clicks, scrolls) THEN the system SHALL support configurable interaction patterns
4. IF a website uses anti-bot measures THEN the system SHALL implement stealth techniques to avoid detection
5. WHEN scraping multiple pages THEN the system SHALL support pagination and link following

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want AI-powered content processing to intelligently parse extracted data, so that I can automatically structure unstructured web content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN raw HTML content is extracted THEN the system SHALL use AI to identify and extract relevant data fields
2. WHEN processing text content THEN the system SHALL classify and categorize information automatically
3. WHEN encountering structured data THEN the system SHALL preserve relationships and hierarchies
4. IF content contains multiple data types THEN the system SHALL separate and organize them appropriately
5. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores for extracted data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want a real-time monitoring dashboard to track scraping operations, so that I can oversee data collection progress and system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display current scraping job status and progress
2. WHEN scraping jobs are running THEN the system SHALL show real-time metrics including success rates and errors
3. WHEN viewing historical data THEN the system SHALL provide charts and visualizations of scraping performance
4. IF errors occur during scraping THEN the system SHALL display error details and suggested actions
5. WHEN jobs complete THEN the system SHALL show summary statistics and data quality metrics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a RESTful API to programmatically access scraped data and control scraping operations, so that I can integrate the scraper with other systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints for starting, stopping, and monitoring scraping jobs
2. WHEN requesting scraped data THEN the system SHALL return data in JSON format with proper pagination
3. WHEN submitting scraping configurations THEN the system SHALL validate and store job parameters
4. IF API authentication is required THEN the system SHALL implement secure token-based authentication
5. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want robust error handling and recovery mechanisms, so that scraping operations can continue despite individual failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
2. WHEN websites return error responses THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue with remaining URLs
3. WHEN Selenium encounters page load issues THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery strategies
4. IF memory or resource limits are reached THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle resource constraints
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL send notifications and maintain system stability

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want automated data cleaning and validation, so that I can trust the quality of scraped data without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is extracted THEN the system SHALL automatically remove duplicates and invalid entries
2. WHEN processing text data THEN the system SHALL normalize formatting and encoding
3. WHEN validating data types THEN the system SHALL convert and validate field formats
4. IF data quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL flag problematic records for review
5. WHEN cleaning is complete THEN the system SHALL provide data quality reports

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want flexible data export capabilities in multiple formats, so that I can use scraped data in various downstream applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL support CSV and JSON formats
2. WHEN generating exports THEN the system SHALL allow filtering and field selection
3. WHEN exporting large datasets THEN the system SHALL support chunked downloads
4. IF custom export formats are needed THEN the system SHALL provide configurable export templates
5. WHEN exports are requested THEN the system SHALL generate downloadable files with proper metadata

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities, so that I can troubleshoot issues and optimize system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scraping operations run THEN the system SHALL log all activities with appropriate detail levels
2. WHEN system resources are consumed THEN the system SHALL monitor CPU, memory, and network usage
3. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL store historical performance data
4. IF system thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts and notifications
5. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information
