# Security Recommendations for Dependencies

## 🚨 Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Update Vulnerable Packages
```toml
# Replace in pyproject.toml
"python-jose[cryptography]>=3.3.4",  # Was 3.3.0
"requests>=2.32.0",                  # Was 2.31.0
"aiohttp>=3.9.5",                    # Was 3.9.0
"bleach>=6.1.0",                     # Was 6.0.0
"uvicorn[standard]>=0.27.0",         # Was 0.24.0
```

### 2. Add Security-Focused Dependencies
```toml
# Add these for enhanced security
"cryptography>=41.0.0",
"certifi>=2023.7.22",
"urllib3>=2.0.7",
```

### 3. Pin Critical Dependencies
```toml
# Pin these for stability
"fastapi==0.109.0",
"pydantic==2.6.0",
"sqlalchemy==2.0.25",
```

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- Use `python-dotenv>=1.0.0` ✅ Already included
- Never commit `.env` files
- Use strong encryption keys (64+ characters)

### API Security
- Implement rate limiting with `slowapi`
- Add request validation middleware
- Use HTTPS in production

### Data Protection
- Hash sensitive data with `passlib[bcrypt]` ✅ Already included
- Implement data retention policies
- Use encrypted database connections

## 🛡️ Additional Security Packages to Consider

```toml
# Optional security enhancements
"slowapi>=0.1.9",        # Rate limiting
"python-multipart>=0.0.6", # File upload security
"httpx>=0.26.0",         # Modern HTTP client
"tenacity>=8.2.0",       # Retry with backoff
```
